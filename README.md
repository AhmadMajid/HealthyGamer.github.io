# Healthy Gamer Coding Resources Repository

## What is Healthy Gamer?
[Healthy Gamer](https://www.healthygamer.gg/about-us/) is on a mission to change the face of mental health. Because weâ€™ve been there. And you deserve the support of people who get it. Our goal is to deliver accessible, inclusive, and affordable resources to gamers who need a way forward.

## What is this repository?
The [Healthy Gamer Discord server](https://healthygamer.ck.page/09c07d7d1d) includes space for people in and around the developer community. A large number of valuable resources for aspiring developers have been collected there. This space was created to take that collection and organize it into a more navigatable form.

## I have an item I'd like to share. Can I add it?
Absolutely! The site includes documentation on how to set the project up locally for editing. If you have a small change, you can also edit it within github.com and submit a pull request from there directly. You will need a Github account to submit changes.
